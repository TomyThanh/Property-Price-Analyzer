# 🏡💰 Property Price Analyzer – Augsburg Edition

> **From raw data to price predictions: A full pipeline for real estate analysis.**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Property Price Analyzer** focuses on real estate in **Augsburg, Germany**.  
The goal is to develop a **Machine Learning model** that can reliably predict housing prices.  

What makes this project unique:  
👉 Every step – from **data collection** and **data cleaning** to **model building** – is done **entirely from scratch**.  

---

## 🔥 Project Status

- ✅ **Data Collection**: Collected and structured from multiple sources  
- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Outlier handling, encoding, missing values, normalization  
- 🚧 **Modeling**: In progress (ML algorithms, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning)
